## Opening your pull request

Thank you for your suggestions! Ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Your pull request should have a useful title.
- The link you add is about the latest Rhasspy version (currently 2.5.x).
- Only add something that is truly awesome and stands out.
- Add your link to the category it belongs to. Try to avoid creating completely new categories. Just add it to **Miscellaneous** then.
- Resources in other languages than English are fine, but make the language clear in your contribution.
- Add your link in the following format: `- [example](https://www.example.com) - An example project that does stuff.`
- Try to always submit HTTPS links.
- The description starts with an uppercase character and ends with a period.

### For projects

- Add the project alphabetically (case-insensitive) in the relevant section.
- The project should have documentation, with a README file as a minimum requirement.
- The project should have a license.
- Don't add a project that is unmaintained, has an archived repository, or is described as deprecated.

### For resources (such as tutorials)

- Add the link at the end of the relevant section.

## Updating your pull request

A lot of times, making a PR adhere to the standards above can be difficult.
If the maintainers notice anything that we'd like changed, we'll ask you to
edit your PR before we merge it. There's no need to open a new PR, just edit
the existing one. If you're not sure how to do that,
[here is a guide](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md)
on the different ways you can update your PR so that we can merge it.
